# Greeting using Blockchain Techology

This is a simple project I created for [Badger Blockchain](https://www.badgerblockchain.com/) which is a club at UW-Madison. 

## Dependencies
1. Download the most recent recommended version of node.js which can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. In order to obtain this interface on your local machine you must first pull down the repository. You can do this in your vscode terminal 
with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/jpgundrum/blockchain_greeting.git
```
Open the folder you just created in vscode (or editor of your choice) to see the files.

3. Next you will need to install the following dependencies:

**npm**
```
npm install
```
**HardHat**
```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
**HardHat packages**
```
npm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

## Metamask ðŸ¦Š
Before you can start your personal blockchain you must download the [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/) for your default browser. 
After getting Metamask on your browser you need to enable test networks. Go to settings and click on the advanced tab. There is an option to show
test networks, and make sure this is enabled. You can switch networks by clicking in the "Ethereum Mainet" dropdown. For this project since you will be running the
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) locally, select the network called local 8545. Now your wallet is ready to be connected!

I recommend to create a new account to perform the transactions on, especially if you have funds in your main account. You can easily add new accounts to your wallet by clicking the 
"import account" button. This will be referenced more below.


## Start your first local blockchain!
To start your local EVM machine (HardHat network) you must type the cmd:
```
npx hardhat node
```
After this command is execeuted, your computer will be running its own Ethereum node. In order to see balances of these nodes in your local testnet Metamask wallet you must do the following:
* Copy a private key from one of the accounts that is displayed in the cli after starting your EVM
* In Metamask, after clicking "Import Account" there will be a field asking for a private key. Paste your key here. This is the wallet where you funds will be added. Use this account to perform transactions.

The next command deploys the smart contract to the local EVM network and sets a default greeting. After this is sent, the Metamask account you just imported should be updated with eth.
Run this script in a different terminal because you EVM needs to be running.
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Go into the frontend folder which contains Javascript, CSS, and React elements used in the webpage.
Then finally start the server!
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
Congratulations! Your first web3 site is active! 

## Errors
The starting logic for the code is found /frontend/src/App.js starting with the return function. Start to debug here. I will continue to add documentation as I learn more. Any suggestions? I am here for them.

**NONCE ERROR??** Try resetting your Metamask account. (Majorirty of errors I run into disappear after resetting)
**Anything else?** Inspect webpage and go to console to see specific error message. Google and debug.

## References/Disclaimer
I am not responsible for the majority of this code! The blog post by Nader Dabit which is found [here](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13)
heavily inspried me. It is a well thought out tutorial. I recommend to read and watch his youtube video on the topic. Listening to him talk through the steps and give explanations is crucial for comphrension. [His repository](https://github.com/dabit3/full-stack-ethereum) was what I pulled down originally, to understand and eventually replicate his creation. I did use CSS and other React elements
to make it more of my own, so it doesn't look like a direct copy and paste. This is meant for education purposes to get college students exposed to blockchain technology.
